# Computer Science Courses Review

This is an ongoing, personal effort on my part to refresh my CS acumen from my university days.

What this repo covers
---------------------

  > As I mentioned earlier, this is an ongoing effort, so this list is subject to changes as frequent
  as I read the material. ;-)

### CLRS

From the esteemed Introduction to Algorithms book by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein:

  * Chapters 1-9: in the `cs-alg` module, since they are more concerned with algorithms
  * Chapters 10-11: in the `cs-ds` module, since they are more of a data structure-oriented nature.
